# GA MLB Big Board

  [MLB BigBoard](https://bigboard.herokuapp.com/)

  The app uses The SportsDB, a free sports data api, to supply data on the next 15 MLB games to be played. A user account may select the game of interest and place a bet on one of the teams to win. Each wager placed or completed will appropriately change the account balance.
  
  The existing account, Sam "Ace" Rothstien, has been created as an example. Feel free to creat your own!

  The current API is free and I am very thankful to have it available. Some functionality I would like to implement requires more granular information, and the next version of the Big Board will include an api that reports final scores of the games. 

  

## Technologies used:
  MERN stack (MongoDb, Express, React, Node), Materialize, git, git-hub Projects, Heroku, 3rd party API
  
## Process:
-  White-boarding to establish overview of project, workflows, processes, and data strucuture.

-  Reasses project goals as progress unfolds. Change goals and deadlines as needed in order to reach MVP at deadline.  

-  Minimum Viable Prodect reached. Work on strech goals as time permits.
